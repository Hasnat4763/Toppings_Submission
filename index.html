    <h1> T-34-85</h1>
    <p>
        The T-34 is a Soviet medium tank from WW2. It was designed in the late 1930s and is still used by North Korea.
        It is one of the most produced tanks in history and also being the tank that suffered the most casualties in the battle. It was renowned even by the germans durinh operation Barbarossa.
        It's sloped armor gave it an edge over the German counterparts in the start of the war. It was so cheap and easy to produce that germans would always face a force that is bigger than their own.
        The most known model of this series of tank is the T-34-85, appearing in many movies and video games such as Call of Duty World At War.
